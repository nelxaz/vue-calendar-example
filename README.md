# vue-calendar

# DISCLAIMER

This project was made to practice the new composition API before the release of Vue 3.

# What I used

1. Vue
   - Composition API
2. Vuetify
3. Firebase

# Problems

- There are warns when using the Calendar component from Vuetify, I believe it's a known issue with Vue or Vuetify.

- I couldn't manage to work the function `getFormatter` from the calendar ref using the composition API, might come back later if I know how to solve it.
